Makefile correctly set up:				2/2
Code well structured:					1/2
Code properly formatted and commented: 			4/4
Code works correctly for hex output: 			3/4
Code works correctly for decimal output: 		3/4
Code works correctly for formatted character output: 	1/4

This is not a bad effort.
The hex and decimal outputs are good.
However, note that the output omits the final byte.
This is due to the for loop condition in line 22; change nBytes-1 to nBytes.
A similar mistake is in the printDecimal() function.
The main issues are in the second half of the source.
The character output prints incorrect hex values -- see line 83. Here you use the varaible count1
before it is initialised. A similar thing happens with count2; if you run the program in character 
mode on your own source code print.c, you will see this clearly.
Also, in line 83, you supply printf() with too many arguments.
Otherwise, the formatting and commenting is very good.
